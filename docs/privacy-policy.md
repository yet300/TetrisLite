# TetrisLite Privacy Policy

Effective date: December 19, 2025

## 1. Overview

TetrisLite is an offline game published by The Tool company (package `com.yet.tetris`). The app does
not collect, transmit, store or share any personal or device data. By installing or using the app
you agree to this statement.

## 2. Data We Process

We do **not** process any personal data, usage analytics, identifiers, or diagnostic logs. Gameplay
runs fully on your device without storing information outside of volatile memory that is cleared
automatically when you close the app. The app has no network communication, advertising SDKs,
third‑party analytics, or payment components.

## 3. Purpose of Processing

Because no data is collected or stored, there is no data processing beyond the temporary
calculations needed to render gameplay during your active session.

## 4. Storage and Security

No user-related data is persisted, so nothing is stored locally or remotely and nothing is shared
with third parties. Standard operating-system protections (Android, iOS, desktop, web) ensure the
executable cannot access information outside its sandbox.

## 5. User Controls

There is no personal data to review, export, or delete. Simply uninstalling the app removes the
software entirely, and no leftover records remain on the device.

## 6. Children

The game targets a general audience aged 13+. We do not knowingly collect personal data from
children under 13. Parents or legal guardians can contact us to remove any information that a child
may have submitted voluntarily.

## 7. Device Permissions

The app does not request access to location, contacts, microphone, camera, storage, Bluetooth, or
any other sensitive device feature. Internet access is not used.

## 8. Policy Updates

We may update this document when new functionality is introduced. The latest version will always be
available in this repository and referenced on the Google Play listing. Significant changes will be
communicated through an in‑app notice or store update.

## 9. Contact

For any privacy questions or concerns, contact us at `ruslan00royale@proton.me` (subject:
“TetrisLite – Privacy”). If you do not agree with this policy, please uninstall and stop using the
app.
